# Scroll-n-react
> A react component library...
## Description

### Primary Objective
> Scroll-n-react is a React Component Library for creating components that trigger functions at a certain scroll length. This is to create potentially infinite scrollers. There are other infinite scroller component libraries out ther but none that I have seen easily replicate features like the facebook messenger load more messages feature.

### Secondary Objective
> Extract boilerplate for creating Javascript Libraries with Typescript. Checkout the boilerplate branch before its merged.
